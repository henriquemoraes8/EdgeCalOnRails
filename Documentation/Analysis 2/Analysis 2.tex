% Writen Analysis (25%) Along with every software deliverable, you will turn in a written docu- ment which will cover two main points:

% 1. A retrospective on how your previous design choices impacted your work to meet the current set of requirements. This section should analyze not only where your good design choices made things easy, but also where your bad design choices made things hard. For both of these points, you should analyze how/why these design choices helped or hindered you. For bad design choices, you should discuss what you might have done differently in the past to avoid the problem this time around.

% 2. An evaluation of your current design, with an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses going forwards. This section should justify your current design choices, explaining why you think they will be beneficial to you in the long run. If you recognize weaknesses in your current design, you should discuss themâ€”including an explanation of why they are there, and how you plan to fix them in future submissions.

% These documents should not only deep analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of your design choice, but also be well written. Ideally, the retrospective section of submission N would connect back to the forward-looking analysis of submission N-1 (i.e., Did things you think would be beneficial actually end up helping you? Did the weaknesses you identified come back to bite you? Did you fix your weaknesses this time around?).
