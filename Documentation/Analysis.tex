% Writen Analysis (25%) Along with every software deliverable, you will turn in a written docu- ment which will cover two main points:

% 1. A retrospective on how your previous design choices impacted your work to meet the current set of requirements. This section should analyze not only where your good design choices made things easy, but also where your bad design choices made things hard. For both of these points, you should analyze how/why these design choices helped or hindered you. For bad design choices, you should discuss what you might have done differently in the past to avoid the problem this time around.

% 2. An evaluation of your current design, with an analysis of its strengths and weaknesses going forwards. This section should justify your current design choices, explaining why you think they will be beneficial to you in the long run. If you recognize weaknesses in your current design, you should discuss themâ€”including an explanation of why they are there, and how you plan to fix them in future submissions.

% These documents should not only deep analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of your design choice, but also be well written. Ideally, the retrospective section of submission N would connect back to the forward-looking analysis of submission N-1 (i.e., Did things you think would be beneficial actually end up helping you? Did the weaknesses you identified come back to bite you? Did you fix your weaknesses this time around?).

\section{Introduction}
In this project, we worked in a team of four to develop an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Logo computer programming language designed in 1967. Our design allows users to develop complex scripts combining conditionals, loops, variables, and other commands that execute on a \quotes{Turtle}, which moves around a space and draws lines and other graphical elements. Our program also provides a robust User Interface that allows users to view the state of the environment and interact with the turtle through a variety of different means.

After looking back on the last five weeks, I feel like I have improved greatly on my project and team management skills. Most importantly, however, I feel my software design techniques have improved significantly. In particular, I feel I was able to successful encapsulate objects and separate objects behavior from their implementation, which was especially important when it came to separating the Model and the View. I also feel I was able to design a consistent, powerful, and complete API that was open to new extensions when it came to the complete implementation phase. 

Overall, I am fairly satisfied with our end result. Although I do see much room for improvement, I do feel I have improved significantly from where I was on Cell Society and am starting to gain a strong grasp on good design practices.
